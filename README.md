# My Portfolio Site

A portfolio site for displaying the projects that I have worked on and completed

I want this to serve as an easy way to illustrate the domains in which I am proficient
while also being in and of itself a demonstration of my ability to make modern dynamic websites.

## Current areas I want to highlight:

### My Language Repertoire

#### C++

Showcased by:
    
    - ChessBible
    - OpenGL target Practice

#### Python

Showcased by:
    
    - TBD. Maybe?: One of my Web-scraping projects,
    I should create some data manipulation project as that is mainly what it's used for
    Find and refurbish one of my old projects that I have made

#### Full-Stack Web Development

The Website itself should showcase my knowledge of how to build modern and dynamic sites
utilizing frameworks like React with Next.js and Typescript.
I should also showcase my ability to work with and understand lower level web development from my experience with "WebsiteBusiness" which was built with raw PHP and Javascript with some JQuery

### Testing Implementations

Highlight my proficiency in implementing testing frameworks throughout my showcase projects

### Additional Skills

Get a good competitive programming knowledge

Version control usage (hard to develop and display as I mainly work alone)

Demonstrate my in depth theoretical knowledge of the field despite my lack of degree.
